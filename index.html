        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I’m a passionate and driven data analytics student at Western Governors University, nearing the finish line of my Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics. I bring a unique blend of personal dedication, adaptability, and teamwork, honed during an extended period of homeschooling and caring for a child on the autism spectrum. While I may have a gap in traditional work history, this time strengthened my skills in time management, organization, and developing solutions under pressure.

Through managing my son's educational journey, I led and participated in team-based educational meetings where we crafted creative, tailored solutions to address his specific learning needs. This experience taught me to adapt quickly, stay resilient, and employ patience- traits essential for collaborating in dynamic and fast-paced roles in data and analytics. As a WGU student, I’ve demonstrated the ability to learn independently, stay disciplined, and master concepts quickly— skills that WGU’s competency-based model demands, where success is measured solely through final projects or exams.

I am excited to bring my skills in data, problem-solving, and collaborative work to a professional environment. My commitment to excellence, curiosity, and team-oriented mindset drive me to contribute meaningfully and grow continuously. I’m ready to embark on this next chapter and am thrilled about the opportunity to make a difference through data!
