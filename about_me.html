            <p>Hello! I’m a passionate and driven data analytics student at Western Governors University, nearing the finish
                line of my Bachelor of Science in Data Analytics. I bring a unique blend of personal <b>dedication,
                    adaptability, and teamwork</b>, honed during an extended period of homeschooling and caring for a child on the autism spectrum.
                While I may have a gap in traditional work history, this time strengthened my skills in <b>time management,
                organization, and developing solutions under pressure.</b>
                <br><br>
            Through managing my son's educational journey, I led and participated in team-based educational meetings where we
                <b>crafted creative, tailored solutions</b> to address his specific learning needs. This experience taught me to
                <b>adapt quickly, stay resilient, and employ patience</b>- traits essential for collaborating in dynamic and fast-paced roles
                in data and analytics. As a WGU student, I’ve demonstrated the ability to <b>learn independently, stay disciplined,
                and master concepts quickly</b>— skills that WGU’s competency-based model demands, where success is measured solely
                through a single final project or exam.
            <br><br>
            I am excited to bring my skills in data, problem-solving, and collaborative work to a professional environment. My
                <b>commitment to excellence, curiosity, and team-oriented mindset</b> drive me to contribute meaningfully and grow
                continuously. I’m ready to embark on this next chapter and am thrilled about the opportunity to make a difference
                through data!
